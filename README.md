# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2023 written entirely in Haskell. Apart from restricting myself to Haskell, anything goes!

Solutions for each day are located in the `src` directory. You can run the solutions with `cabal run -- <days>`, where `<days>` is a list of days you want to try,
E.g. `cabal run -- 1 2 5`. If no days are given, it will run all of them!
